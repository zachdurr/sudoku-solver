Sudoku Solver


This is a javascript project that allows a user to enter any assortment of numbers into a 9 x 9 sudoku board and will generate a solution (if there is one) by fetching from an API (Solve Sudoku https://rapidapi.com/sosier/api/solve-sudoku/). 

To get started, in your terminal run 'npm start:backend', then navigate to index.html in your browser. Fill in whichever squares you desire and hit the 'Solve' button.
